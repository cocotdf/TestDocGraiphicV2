<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>The “SquaredHinge” metric is commonly used in the field of machine learning, more specifically in classification tasks. It is a variant of “Hinge Loss”, which is often used with Support Vector Machines (SVM), a popular technique for classification tasks.</p>

<p>SquaredHinge” squares the margin loss, further punishing prediction errors. It is particularly useful when you want to give greater weight to larger errors.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of specific areas where the SquaredHinge can be used :</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Image recognition : in image classification tasks, “SquaredHinge” can be used to train an SVM model to distinguish between different image categories.</li>
<li>Anomaly detection : support vector machines are often used in anomaly detection tasks, and the use of “SquaredHinge” can help to put more emphasis on observations that are far from the decision frontier.</li>
<li>Text classification : SVMs are also commonly used in text classification tasks, such as spam detection or sentiment analysis, where SquaredHinge can be used as a loss function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculation</h2>

<p>The SquaredHinge metric is mainly used in binary classification tasks where y_true values are expected to be -1 or 1. If binary labels (0 or 1) are provided, they will be converted to -1 or 1. <br/>It calculates the squared hinge loss, which is defined as the maximum between 0 and 1 minus the product of the true label and the prediction.</p>

<p>This function penalizes incorrect predictions more heavily than the standard hinge loss, which is why it is often used when prediction accuracy is particularly important.</p>
